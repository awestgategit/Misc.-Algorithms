# misc-algorithms
Some examples of algorithms I've completed as part of school work or side projects.

Apriori, Sampling and Toivonen were created my sophomore year to learn association rules for a research project that eventually (and confusingly) became the Sentiment Lexicon Expansion Graph algorithm.

Smith-Waterman was an algorithm implemented for a Bioinformatics homework.
